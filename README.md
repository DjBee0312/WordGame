To create this game I used Unity and C#;

# Some text for T.Shemsedinov;

```c#
public int GetMark(person TimurGafarovich) 

{

  int Mark;

  //In this code I used
  
  Mark += pattern observer;
  
  Mark += writing in files;
  
  Mark += reading from files;
  
  Mark += generics;
  
  Mark += sorting methods;
  
  //Mark += some async stuff;(If be honest - there is noo async)
  
  return Mark;
  
}
```
